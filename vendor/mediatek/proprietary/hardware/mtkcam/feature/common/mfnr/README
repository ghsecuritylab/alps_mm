MFNR Middleware


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

Provide camera middleware a feature: Multi Frame Noise Reduction.
MFNR middleware is completed within two parts:


1. MFNR Core

MFNR Core always uses interfaces of MFNR (which located in folder includes),
and it's a hardware independent pure software core, but the interfaces are
supposed to be implemented or the MFNR Core won't effect anymore.


2. MFNR Modules

MFNR Modules represents a role of providing hardware dependent operations, such
as image buffer processing, hardware blending or mixing. But here we still do
provide a version of MFNR Modules that is pure software and hardware independent
for user just want to verify the control flow or build pass.

To determine the version of MFNR Module, MFLL_MODULE_VERSION should be specified
in Android.mk.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1. libutils.so
2. libcutils.so

And depends on different version of MFNR Modules, you need different libs.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

All modules (e.g. Camera HAL or an unit test) should use
IMfllCore as the public interface to talk with MFNR core.

All the source code of this program were written by MediaTek co..
